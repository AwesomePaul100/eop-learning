# EOP Learning Hub (GitHub Pages Template)

A modern, responsive static site inspired by the Engineering for One Planet (EOP) initiative. Includes:

- **Home (EOP Overview)** with an original, non-plagiarized summary and a generic SVG figure.
- **Case Studies**, **Projects**, **Industry Insight**, and **Interviews** pages marked as "Coming soon".
- Clean CSS (no external dependencies), mobile nav, and Open Graph metadata.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a repository** on GitHub — any name works (e.g., `eop-learning-hub`).
2. Upload the contents of this folder (or push via Git).
3. In your repo, go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master`), **/root**
   - Click **Save**. Your site will be published at the URL shown on the page.
4. (Optional) If using a project site instead of `username.github.io`, set **Custom domain** as needed.

## Local Edits

- Edit `index.html` to update the overview text.
- Add content to `case-studies.html`, `projects.html`, `industry-insights.html`, and `interviews.html` as it becomes available.
- Customize colors in `assets/css/styles.css` under `:root`.

## Notes

- This template avoids frameworks/CDNs to keep Pages-friendly and fast.
- If you add folders that start with an underscore (e.g., Jekyll), consider adding a `.nojekyll` file.
